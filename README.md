GreasySpoon
===========
Project The Greasy Spoon fulfilled the second assignment in my Intro to Visual & Procedural Programming class. I built a Point-of-Sale application for a Diner, minus the financial transaction ability, and designed the application as though a person unknowledgeable of the Diner could understand and use it. 

Using VB.NET in Visual Studio 2013, I built the GUI (main.vb) using simple, clear images of menu items.  For each menu item selected a new custom form pops up, facilitating a focused selection of toppings and flavors and eliminating cashier mistakes and erroneous customer charges. A list box holds the live order items as they are passed back to main, ultimately creating a receipt of the purchase and thanking the customer.
