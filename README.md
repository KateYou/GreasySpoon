GreasySpoon
===========
Student project The Greasy Spoon fulfilled the second assignment in my Intro to Visual & Procedural Programming class. Requirements included building a Point of Sale application for a Diner, minus the financial transaction ability.  Using VB.NET in Visual Studio 2013, I built the GUI (main.sln) using simple, clear images of menu items.  For each menu item selected, a new custom form pops up, facilitating a focused selection of toppings and flavors and removing the possibility of user mistake and erroneous customer charges. A list box holds the live order items as they are passed back to main, creating a receipt of the purchase and thanking the customer.
